Where to find...
- **the documentation**: In the "bugyi" folder
- **the Intellij project**: In the src folder *(If you clone the repo, you can import it in Intellij, but you might have to set the SDK to yours, as we are doing the same, mixing OpenJDK and Oracle)*

and you can find the text files *(.puml)* of some of the diagrams in the diagrams folder.
If you want to open these, you can use, for example, https://www.planttext.com/
